## 🎨 What Was Done

✅ Created favicon (blue "T" logo)  
✅ Created white theme CSS with InfoCert colors  
✅ Built Docker image with branding  
✅ Created build system on droplet  
✅ Wrote complete documentation

## ⏳ What's Next

⏳ User finishing other SwissKnife modifications  
⏳ User will explain "deeper integration" approach  
⏳ Deploy to production (`https://oh.bitsync.it`)  
⏳ Test and verify

---

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy?

**Quick deploy (3 steps):**
```bash
ssh root@161.35.214.46  # password: Fr3qu3nc1.
cd /opt/swissknife
nano docker-compose.yml  # Change line 72 to: image: trusty-agent:0.59
docker-compose up -d openhands
```

**BUT WAIT!** User wants to explain "deeper integration" first.  
Current approach is surface-level (Docker + CSS overlay).
