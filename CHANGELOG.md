### 📝 Notes

#### User Feedback
- User finds current approach acceptable but wants "deeper integration"
- Current solution is surface-level (Docker image with CSS)
- User will explain deeper integration approach after completing other SwissKnife work

#### Known Limitations
- Branding is CSS-only (no actual logo images displayed, just text)
- Requires rebuild when OpenHands updates
- Local image only (not in registry)

#### Decisions Made
- Chose white theme over dark theme (user requirement)
- Used Tinexta InfoCert blue (#0072CE) as primary color
- Named product "Trusty Agent" (vs "Trusty PA" which is for personal files)
- Decided to hide OpenHands logo via CSS rather than remove it
